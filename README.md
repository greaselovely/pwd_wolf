# Why PowerShell?

I wrote this in a closed environment using tools that were readily available and it was pretty easy and 'fun' to do.  I'll probably fart around on a python one for fun too.

# Variables

Change them as needed.  For instance turn everything off except special characters and see the 'hilarious' passwords it generates.
