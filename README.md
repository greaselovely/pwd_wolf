# gen_pwd.ps1

A PowerShell script that retrieves passwords from  <a href="https://passwordwolf.com" target="_blank">PasswordWolf</a>, shows you all the passwords generated, and allows you to select one.  Once you select the password, it copies it to your clipboard.

# Tested on

Windows, Mac OSX, Ubuntu

# Why PowerShell?

I wrote this in a closed environment using tools that were readily available and it was pretty easy and 'fun' to do.  I'll probably fart around on a python one for fun too.

# Variables

Change them as needed.  For instance turn everything off except special characters and see the 'hilarious' passwords it generates.
